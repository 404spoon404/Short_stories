Prologue

**Where it is very cold/A cow has a limp/The sale of the farm is discussed/Someone wins a price**

Cold air blew into the room as he opened the hallway door. "The cow have their food and I've cleared most of the snow." He said rubbing his hands together to get a bit of warmth back into them. The old man sat down heavily at the table. His wife was at the counter preparing breakfast. From the stove she got the coffeepot and filled his mug. "Drink, warm up." "It seems colder every year" he said as she put the basket with bread on the table and sat down herself. Outside it was still dark. She knew there were snow covered mountains all around.

She saw how it hurt him to pick up the warm mug with his cold hands. From the basket she took a bun, cut it and put cheese between the halves. "Clara had something wrong with her feet this morning. I'll call Heinz later and see if he has time to come and take a look at her." It was allways the cow's named Clara that had trouble with walking. She smiled as she tought it might be something in the name. "You sure you want to call him out in this weather? It can't be easy for him to get out here." "It'll be fine. I know he does not just want to sit at home." They finished their meal and she cleared the table. Dieter went back into the cold to do some work in his workshop.

Heinz went into the house after taking a look at the limping cow. Although he found it was nothing serious Dieter still wanted to stay in the stables. Keeping watch. "Hallo?" He yelled in the hallway. "Come in, come in." Grethe called back from the front kitchen. He found his own mug allready waithing for him on the kitchen table. As he sat down Grethe was hobbeling around getting the milk and sugar and putting some cookies on a plate. The mug had a small chip on the rim from when he had dropped it years ago. Since then it was his mug and it had been standing, waiting for him as he came by. "How is Clara?" she asked, sitting down. "She will be fine. A bit of trouble with het hoove. It will heal. She is just getting a bit older." As we all are he thought looking across the table and feeling his cold toes.

"We have put the farm up for sale" She said after they had been sitting for a while. He kept on looking at the yard and nodded. "It was time. The children do not want to take over and we are having more and more trouble keeping up." she continued as he took another sip of his coffee. "How is Dieter feeling about it?" Heinz asked. "I think he accepts it. It is not his family that has had it for so many years." Now he looked at Grethe. "And you?" Silence for a bit. "It will take me some time, I think." She said with a sigh. "Times have changed. And we can't force the childeren to do something they don't want to do. Especially in these times." She looked outside. "They both have good jobs and a life in the city." Heinz nodded again. "There is a reason your farm was the last in the valley."

They sat for a while in silence finishing their coffee. Afterwards Heinz went back outside looking for Dieter. He found him, still in the stable looking at his cows. He got another stool from a corner and sat down as well. The air in the stable was warmed by the cows making it almost warm inside. Picking his glasses off his nose he cleaned them on his shirt. "You've heard about the sale from Grethe? Heinz nodded his glasses still in hand Dieters face a blur. "It is hard on her. The family has been farming here for at least four generations. I only came in later when we married." Putting his glasses back on Heinz replied. "I think you took good care of it. Farming is getting harder and harder around here. It takes a young person to grow the business." Dieter smiled. Fifteen cows and a few fields were enough to feed a family and make us happy."

"I've won. I really won!" Laying in bed the tought kept me awake. The wining ticked on the nightstand right next to me. I was happy they let me keep it. Maybe I should have it framed. This and other thought just kept running on. Today it had all become real. First the champagne and congratulations and forms and advice about accountants and banking. Then the ride back home. First class in the train, for the first time. My debit card somehow feeling heavier in my pocket. After the weekend I will quit my job. Then a vacation for a while. Just sit in the sun and think about what I want to do. And after that. Maybe a litte farm. And thinking about the green fields and riding around on tractors I finally fell asleep.

# Hoofdstuk 1
**Where we arrive by train/Drive in a small yellow car/Take a first look at the farm

The train was slowing down. Around us the valley was opening up. On one side there still were steep cliffs but on the other the mountains went further away. Grass meadows appeared. "Erlengrad, Nachste halt, Erlengrad Bahnhof." A voice announced over the speakers. The cliffs on the left side made room for the village. A loading platform with a small road leading further into the mountain and then appartments next to the road. As we slowed to a stop I stood up and picked up my bag. The train came to a halt. Though the open doors I stepped onto the platform. The hot air hit me as I left the airconditioned train. Behind me the doors beeped and closed. I was still looking around as the train drove off again. A few other people had gotten off the train with me. I folllowed hem up the stairs and over the bridge across the tracks.

Most of the people went left to the parking lot as they got off the stairs. I followed them. As I was looking around they got into a small van. Their driver packing luggage into the back. A small man walked up to me. "John?" He asked as he reached out to shake my hand. "I'm Dieter, we talked on the phone." I moved my back to my other hand and we shook hands. He was a lot smaller than me. Balding, with his hair combed over the bald spot in the middle. Tanned and skinny. He dit look old but wiry and his grip felt crushing. "Follow me, lets get to the Doschwo" On the last parking space a small yellow car was waiting for us. Dieter opened the trunk of the ugly duckling. My bag only just fitting inside. I slit onto my chair. Dieter getting in next to me. Our elbows allmost touching. But it was clean inside and the engine did start the first try.

Dieter backed out of the parking spot and put the car in first. Smoothly we drove away the engine reving up. "I would give you a tour of the town but I think you really want to see the farm." I nodded. "There is not much to see anyway." He continued. At the roundabout he took a right around the station. Across the river we stopped for a stop sign before turning left following the water. On the right a couple of houses. Then right at the roundabout. "This is not the fastes way from town but this way we can see the whole farm. The engine was working hard. The road going steep uphill. "The houses here are vacation homes or small bread and breakfasts. There used to be small farms here but they are all gone. Curve after cuve we went higher up the hill. Then a left at another roundabout. More traditional houses. At a field just past them Dieter stopped the car right in the road. "Here on the right is our high field. Behind those tree are the house and the farmyard."

A grassy field with mountainflowers with a small wooden fence in the middle. "To the right of that fence is our neighbours field. A farm from the next village over maintains it for him." On our, my, side of the fence the field lay next to a dense forest with spruce and a few leafy trees. I could see nothting of the farm. Dieter put the car back in gear and we drove on. On the right we passed a small road. A white and red barrier blocking access. "The rear entrance of the farm. We will go around." Dieter said. We were going downhill now. The road pretty steep. At the bottom we were back at the road next to the river. A right turn. "The field next to you is also part of the farm. In between the trees you can just see some of the farmbuildings." I did catch a glimpse of a wooden roof in between the needle trees. Another turn. On our right more trees and left a field of grain. Golden, ready to harvest. "That plot is farmed by the farmer in the next valley. The manage most of the flat fields between the town and the lake." "Hold on we have to keep our speed high to get up here."

With a bump, the springs squeaking, me holding on and Dieter shifting down we drove into another small road. Steep uphill. In a flash a saw white fences around a field with a few cows. Even with the run-up the car almost did not make it to the top. Dieter had to put it into first gear the engine working hard to make it the last few meters. Past another barrier, fortunately open and coming to a stop in front of a classic swiss wooden house. I looked around as I got out of the car. The house was three stories high with a sloped roof. The woord part was build on the concrete first floor. To get to the door you had to use a small concrete stair. Next to the house was an old barn with tractors inside. I caught a glimpse of the red Linder and a wheel that could only be of the Bruhrer was just visible next to it. Everything was like the pictures. The stable across the house and the sheds a bit further out in the yard. "You will get the grand tour later. Grethe is waiting for us." I followed Dieter up the stairs into the house.

In the hallway there were another couple of steps to get up to the door of the kitchen. Dieter pointed to a steep stairway right next to the entrance. "Those lead right into the basement." He went up the steps, opened the door and motioned me into the kitchen. The room cool and pretty dark. The small windows not letting in a lot of light from outside. An old woman was working at the countertop in front of the windows. She looked up when we walked in. "Sit, sit. I'll be right there. You drink coffe, right?" I nodded and took a seat at the table while lookin around. Dark wooden walls. Pictures on every free space. The table had four seats and Dieter sat down across from me. The woman had finished what she was doing and put a small basket on the table. I stood up and we shook hands. "I'm Grethe, welcome to the farm. Please take some cake. I'm sure you are hungry after the trip." I sat back down and took a slice of cake from the basket. Grethe got my coffee and a couple of small plates for the cake. The cake was not too sweet and very compact. More like sweet bread than the cake I was used to. Dieter and Grethe put some jam on theirs and I copied them.

After we had sat for a while and I finished my coffee Dieter was ready to show me around the farm. We went back outside and took a door at the side of the house. Directly behind the door where steep stairs to the first floor. Dieter climbed up and I followed. He paused on the landing pointing at stairs going even further up "If you go up there in the attic are the rooms for our children. They visit every now and then and usually sleep over." I had seen their children in the photographs in the kitchen. A boy and a girl. The boy being the older one. No idea how old they were now. My appartment took up the first floor. Most of the room was for the kichen and living room combination. The walls were freshly painted. Windows on all sides made it pretty bright. At the front I could look out on the yard and at the back I could see trees and the mountain in the distance. A small dinner table,and a lounge set made it pretty comfortable. The long wall on the far side had three doors. Two led to smaller rooms. The one in the corner allready having a bed and closets. The other one still empty. Behind the last door was a pretty big bathroom. I even had a bath, right next to one of the windows. "We had this build in case one of the children wanted to take over the farm. We could live downstairs and they could have their privacy."

Back outside Dieter took me for a tour around the rest of the farmyard. In the stable cows were standing chewing on their grass
