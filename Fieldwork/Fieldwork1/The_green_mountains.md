Prologue

**Where it is very cold/A cow has a limp/The sale of the farm is discussed/Someone wins a price**

Cold air blew into the room as he opened the hallway door. "The cow have their food and I've cleared most of the snow." He said rubbing his hands together to get a bit of warmth back into them. The old man sat down heavily at the table. His wife was at the counter preparing breakfast. From the stove she got the coffeepot and filled his mug. "Drink, warm up." "It seems colder every year" he said as she put the basket with bread on the table and sat down herself. Outside it was still dark. She knew there were snow covered mountains all around.

She saw how it hurt him to pick up the warm mug with his cold hands. From the basket she took a bun, cut it and put cheese between the halves. "Clara had something wrong with her feet this morning. I'll call Heinz later and see if he has time to come and take a look at her." It was allways the cow's named Clara that had trouble with walking. She smiled as she tought it might be something in the name. "You sure you want to call him out in this weather? It can't be easy for him to get out here." "It'll be fine. I know he does not just want to sit at home." They finished their meal and she cleared the table. Dieter went back into the cold to do some work in his workshop.

Heinz went into the house after taking a look at the limping cow. Although he found it was nothing serious Dieter still wanted to stay in the stables. Keeping watch. "Hallo?" He yelled in the hallway. "Come in, come in." Grethe called back from the front kitchen. He found his own mug allready waithing for him on the kitchen table. As he sat down Grethe was hobbeling around getting the milk and sugar and putting some cookies on a plate. The mug had a small chip on the rim from when he had dropped it years ago. Since then it was his mug and it had been standing, waiting for him as he came by. "How is Clara?" she asked, sitting down. "She will be fine. A bit of trouble with het hoove. It will heal. She is just getting a bit older." As we all are he thought looking across the table and feeling his cold toes.

"We have put the farm up for sale" She said after they had been sitting for a while. He kept on looking at the yard and nodded. "It was time. The children do not want to take over and we are having more and more trouble keeping up." she continued as he took another sip of his coffee. "How is Dieter feeling about it?" Heinz asked. "I think he accepts it. It is not his family that has had it for so many years." Now he looked at Grethe. "And you?" Silence for a bit. "It will take me some time, I think." She said with a sigh. "Times have changed. And we can't force the childeren to do something they don't want to do. Especially in these times." She looked outside. "They both have good jobs and a life in the city." Heinz nodded again. "There is a reason your farm was the last in the valley."

They sat for a while in silence finishing their coffee. Afterwards Heinz went back outside looking for Dieter. He found him, still in the stable looking at his cows. He got another stool from a corner and sat down as well. The air in the stable was warmed by the cows making it almost warm inside. Picking his glasses off his nose he cleaned them on his shirt. "You've heard about the sale from Grethe? Heinz nodded his glasses still in hand Dieters face a blur. "It is hard on her. The family has been farming here for at least four generations. I only came in later when we married." Putting his glasses back on Heinz replied. "I think you took good care of it. Farming is getting harder and harder around here. It takes a young person to grow the business." Dieter smiled. Fifteen cows and a few fields were enough to feed a family and make us happy."

"I've won. I really won!" Laying in bed the tought kept me awake. The wining ticked on the nightstand right next to me. I was happy they let me keep it. Maybe I should have it framed. This and other thought just kept running on. Today it had all become real. First the champagne and congratulations and forms and advice about accountants and banking. Then the ride back home. First class in the train, for the first time. My debit card somehow feeling heavier in my pocket. After the weekend I will quit my job. Then a vacation for a while. Just sit in the sun and think about what I want to do. And after that. Maybe a litte farm. And thinking about the green fields and riding around on tractors I finally fell asleep.
