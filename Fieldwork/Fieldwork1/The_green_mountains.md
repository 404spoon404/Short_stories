Prologue

**Where it is very cold/A cow has a limp/The sale of the farm is discussed/Someone wins a price**

Cold air blew into the room as he opened the hallway door. "The cow have their food and I've cleared most of the snow." He said rubbing his hands together to get a bit of warmth back into them. The old man sat down heavily at the table. His wife was at the counter preparing breakfast. From the stove she got the coffeepot and filled his mug. "Drink, warm up." "It seems colder every year" he said as she put the basket with bread on the table and sat down herself. Outside it was still dark. She knew there were snow covered mountains all around.

She saw how it hurt him to pick up the warm mug with his cold hands. From the basket she took a bun, cut it and put cheese between the halves. "Clara had something wrong with her feet this morning. I'll call Heinz later and see if he has time to come and take a look at her." It was allways the cow's named Clara that had trouble with walking. She smiled as she tought it might be something in the name. "You sure you want to call him out in this weather? It can't be easy for him to get out here." "It'll be fine. I know he does not just want to sit at home." They finished their meal and she cleared the table. Dieter went back into the cold to do some work in his workshop.

Heinz went into the house after taking a look at the limping cow. Although he found it was nothing serious Dieter still wanted to stay in the stables. Keeping watch. "Hallo?" He yelled in the hallway. "Come in, come in." Grethe called back from the front kitchen. He found his own mug allready waithing for him on the kitchen table. As he sat down Grethe was hobbeling around getting the milk and sugar and putting some cookies on a plate. The mug had a small chip on the rim from when he had dropped it years ago. Since then it was his mug and it had been standing, waiting for him as he came by. "How is Clara?" she asked, sitting down. "She will be fine. A bit of trouble with het hoove. It will heal. She is just getting a bit older." As we all are he thought looking across the table and feeling his cold toes.
